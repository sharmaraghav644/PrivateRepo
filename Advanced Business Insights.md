Targeted Loan Bundles for Low Risk Segments: Borrowers earning over $100k and holding a Master's or PhD degree exhibit the lowest combined default rate (~9%). Offering premium loan bundles with lower interest rates to this segment could capture high-value, low-risk customers, increasing profitability and loyalty.

Impact: Position your institution as the go-to lender for highly qualified, affluent borrowers.

Dynamic Loan Amount Caps Based on Income Bracket: Default rates increase sharply for loans exceeding $40k, especially in lower income brackets (e.g., 0–40k). Implement income-based loan caps that adjust dynamically to ensure the loan burden aligns with repayment ability.

Impact: Minimize defaults while maintaining inclusivity for lower-income segments.

Reevaluate Small Loan Policies: A 100% default rate for loans under $5k suggests that borrowers use small loans for immediate relief without sufficient repayment capacity. Instead of outright rejection, offer structured alternatives like microfinance coaching or flexible repayment plans.

Impact: Transform risky small-loan applicants into long-term, responsible customers.

Incentivize Co-Signed Loans: Loans with co-signers show 19.5% fewer defaults compared to solo applicants. Create discounted interest rates or perks for co-signed loans, especially in high-risk groups like unemployed or low-income borrowers.

Impact: Reduce defaults while expanding your lending pool to include riskier demographics.

Pre-Approval Alerts for Full-Time Employees in Lower Brackets: Full-time employees with incomes between $40k–60k have a default rate close to high earners (~11%). Roll out proactive pre-approval offers for this group to increase engagement and acquisition of moderate-income, low-risk borrowers.

Impact: Strengthen your market share by targeting a stable, underserved population.
